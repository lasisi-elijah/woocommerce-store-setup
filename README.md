# WooCommerce Store Configuration Guide

This repository documents my process for setting up a complete WooCommerce e-commerce system for business clients.

The goal is to prepare a store that can accept payments, manage inventory, and process customer orders securely.

## 1. Store Initialization

- Install WooCommerce plugin
- Configure store location and currency
- Set measurement units
- Configure business information


## 2. Product Catalog Setup

- Create product categories
- Configure product attributes (size, color, variations)
- Upload product images
- Configure product descriptions
- Manage stock quantities

This allows businesses to manage inventory and product listings.


## 3. Payment Gateway Integration

I configure secure payment systems including:

- Paystack / Stripe / PayPal
- Checkout configuration
- Currency compatibility
- Order confirmation emails

Purpose:
Allow customers to pay online securely.


## 4. Shipping & Tax Configuration

- Create shipping zones
- Flat rate and calculated shipping
- Local pickup options
- Tax rules (if required)

This allows automated order pricing.


## 5. Customer Account System

- Customer registration
- Password security
- Order history
- Email notifications

Customers can track orders and manage accounts.


## 6. Security & Backup

- Secure checkout (HTTPS)
- Anti-spam protection
- Scheduled backups
- Role management

Protects payment and personal data.


## 7. Order Processing Workflow

- Order received
- Payment verification
- Status updates
- Invoice email
- Order completion

I also train the business owner on how to manage orders.


## Final Testing

Before launch I:

- test checkout
- test payment
- test email notifications
- test mobile experience

The store is then ready for customers.
